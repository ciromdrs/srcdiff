# Empty space to fill a diff
# Using special characters to represent the empty space is not a good option because they are not printable or already have a well-defined behavior in the print function.
# Using non-printable characters is neither a good idea because we cannot see them, so debugging gets harder.
# The None value seems the best choice.
